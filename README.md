# Word-Guess Game

In this project, I built a word-guess game, whose goal is for the player to guess a word.

The instruction to start the game is displayed on the screen along with the word to guess (letters hidden of course!), the score of the player (wins), the letters the player already tried and the number of guesses remaining. The player has up to 15 guesses to find the word!

A round ends when the player finds the word or when he/she doesn't have anymore guesses left.

To build this game, I used the following technologies:
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS

Below is a screenshot of the game.
