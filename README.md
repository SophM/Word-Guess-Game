# Word-Guess Game

In this project, I built a word-guess game, whose goal is for the player to guess a word.

[Click me to check the game out!](https://sophm.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/)

The word to guess (with hidden letters!) is displayed on the screen, along with the score of the player (wins/losses), the letters the player already tried and the number of guesses remaining. The player has up to 10 guesses to find the word!

A round ends when the player finds the word or when she/he doesn't have anymore guesses left. At the end of a round, the game starts over automatically and a new word to guess is displayed on the screen.

To avoid the same word to be picked up twice, the chosen word is removed from the word-to-guess list.

To build this game, I used the following technologies:
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS

Below is a screenshot of the game.
