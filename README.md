# Word-Guess Game

In this project, I built a word-guess game, whose goals are for the player to guess a word and learn new things! In fact, if the player guesses the word, a picture representing the word and a fun fact about the word are displayed.

The game has a responsive layout and can be played on different devices.

The word to guess (with hidden letters!) is displayed on the screen, along with the score of the player (wins/losses), the letters the player already tried and the number of guesses remaining. The player has up to 10 guesses to find the word! If the player accidentally presses a letter already tried, she/he doesn't lose a guess for it... You're welcome! :)
The player can only presses letters. If a non-letter key is pressed, a message alerts the user to only press letters.

A round ends when the player finds the word or when she/he doesn't have anymore guesses left. At the end of a round, the game starts over automatically and a new hidden-word to guess is displayed on the screen.

To avoid the same word to be picked up twice, every selected word is removed from the word-to-guess list. When all the words have been selected, the array of possible words is reset so that the player can try again guessing the words if desired.
